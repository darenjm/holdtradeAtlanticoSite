This is my first professional website project. I've been teaching myself how to code using YouTube and Udemy.com. I've been focusing on HTML/CSS and using tutorials to get the jQuery to work where I need it. This is a career move for me as I want to build a business designing and building custom web pages for clients. Once the web site is final and approved by the client I am going to covert the files to PHP and use WordPress to manage the files this way the client can make small changes, edits and blog post in the future with out having to hire any one to do it. 

Any comments, critiques or suggestions are encouraged.
